# Analysis of app reviews

Being interested in air quality awareness in my hometown, I'm curious about what apps are available for this purpose, and what are the feedbacks from their users.
My main questions are:
* What apps are there?
* What are their main features?
* How are they rated?
* What are users looking for when using those apps?
* What expectations are not currently met?
* How do these apps work? Is there a classification for such apps?

To try to answer these questions, I've collected some data: [features and reviews from selected apps on the app store](https://github.com/linetonthat/appstore_scraping/). 
In this project:
* Features and reviews will be preprocessed using NLP tools as needed
* Several analyses are performed to better understand main app features and user expectations.

---
## So far
* Load and pre-process data (JSON format) to export dataset as CSV
* Define a strategy to analyse data
* Identify methods to implement this strategy

---
## On-going activities:
* Learn how to perform preprocessing (NLP methods)

---
## Next steps:
* Segment reviews 
* Tag reviews to have a training dataset
* Test topic classifier
* Investigate "live" apps: Are apps still maintained? Downloaded?
* Have a look at the review texts (strange feeling when reading some of them)
