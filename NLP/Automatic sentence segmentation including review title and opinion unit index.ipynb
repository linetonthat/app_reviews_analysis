    "When users write reviews, they may provide their opinion on different aspects of the app (cf. __[this website](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/aspect-based-sentiment-analysis/)__). They might like one feature from the app, and whish another one was better. Also, in order to assess what topic are of highest interest, we'd like to segment app reviews in ordre to extract \"opinion units\" from users.\n",

    "After reading some app reviews, we've identified how to modify the default rules from spaCy to extract opinion units from our app reviews:\n",
    "* Use the default sentence segmentation from spaCy \n",
    "* Add a rule to the pipeline before the parser, to segment when \"but\" or \"althoug\" are used.\n",
    "* Change the rule to never segment when \"so\" is encountered\n",
    "Empty lines should also be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, since our dataset is not too large, we'll duplicate the review information and associate it with each opinion unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: After going through reviews to identify topics, tags and sentiment, I've realized that for certain reviews, information is mostly in the title. Will add the review title as an opinion unit. Will also add an index for the opinion units, as it may make tagging (topics, sentiment) easier."
