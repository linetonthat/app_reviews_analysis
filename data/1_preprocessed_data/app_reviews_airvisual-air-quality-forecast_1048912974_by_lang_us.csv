4;5333716395;5;Peace of Mind;2019-12-29T08:29:19Z;TangoXray;The app is so helpful as a quick reference to the air quality outside. I don’t have to guess and I know the reading is legitimate and accurate. In London, pollution is a major concern and exacerbates respiratory issues especially for children. I use AirVisual as a guide to determine when I turn on the air purifier for my infant son. The monitoring station is close to where I live so I am getting information that is up-to-date and relevant to the particular area where I live. My next step is to purchase one of the AirVisual monitors so I may see the readings in my own home as well as contribute data to the community. The app is very informative, giving you the basic or in depth information whichever  you may prefer. Keep up the good work!;;;;en

20;5178243338;5;Best air quality app so far;2019-11-21T22:08:44Z;Betsy182;"I live in Northern CA where we call Autumn “fire season” and not because the leaves look like fire. This year was better where I live than past years but you can’t always tell right away when the air is bad or if it has become more dangerous. This app warns you (if you let it) when the air quality has changed, good or bad,  and uses a lot of different data from many sensors around the area including privately owned and EPA etc. that give a much better reading in the micro climate air. It’s very easy to use as well. 
I highly recommend getting this app to keep track of the air quality where ever you go.";;;;en

Since the 1970’s I’ve been personally interested in my home environment mainly because 3 of my family members, my husband & 2 children have hay fever in the Spring. We installed an electronic air filter in our furnace and air conditioning system which seemed to help immensely. 

Fat forward another 30+ years when we discovered the AirVisual app & their small device that could monitor our indoor air quality. Yes, using an AirVisual device is an easy way to monitor and improve your own air quality in your home. I discovered that NOT opening the windows to bring in a little fresh air was bad for us. Our carbon dioxide CO2 levels were getting in a higher range and causing headaches and lethargic behaviors. Being retired and at home most of the time, this became even more important to monitor our indoor AQI. Thank you AirVisual for providing the tools and information for a healthier lifestyle. 🥰";;;;en

It can irritate you, hurt your head and your heart, kill you or cause dementia. Checking air quality before engaging in outdoor work is vital especially in summer months. This is a simple but well-designed app that will display pollution levels and warnings for whichever monitoring stations you select. It can also provide notifications of changes in air quality. I have not yet come across intrusive tracking, data collection or advertising; it's not necessary to create an account to use it. I check it before working outside just as I check the (standard) weather forecast. Perhaps if we use products like these we'll come to see how we are, without exaggeration, poisoning ourselves.
Highly recommended.";;;;en

23;3766983115;5;Great international coverage;2019-02-14T01:27:14Z;Don_iPad;I spend a couple of months every year in northeast rural Thailand visiting my wonderful Thai in-laws. AirVisual's coverage of Thailand is excellent and helps guide me in taking antihistamines and using an inhaler when the sugar cane farmers are burning their crops. They do this prior to harvesting the sugar cane before they sell their sugar cane to the processing plants. Although the Thai government is actively encouraging the farmers to adopt different methods to improve air quality, the burn method quickly and efficiently prepares the sugar cane for harvesting. Consequently, change is slow. Beyond Thailand, I appreciate AirVisual's accurate air quality measurements and the ability to make a list of cities to monitor air quality.;7292550.0;Thank you for your detailed review.

The smoke during “fire season” (May-Oct) is the worst air quality practically of our nation. 
I was able to compare to New Delhi which is absolutely horrible air quality !!
I promised myself I would not have my summers robbed from me again because of this poor air quality in Grants Pass Oregon. 
Air Visual really guided me through this uncertain experience. 
The air quality was so poor it was advised to limit my outdoor activities. 
I recently left Oregon  & went back to my hometown of San Diego Ca to help family.

87;3599658245;5;This app is great!;2019-01-01T14:25:27Z;Derik H;The information about air quality is available but it used to take a lot of work to find and interpret,  AirVisual takes that away and makes it a one click event. I often plan my day around the information.  An example-While recently traveling to Bogota I learned the air pollution was spiking over night, each night while I was there.  I moved my exercise from early morning to early evening and avoided massive exposure.  I am healthier because of it.;;;;en

Now that the smoke has (mostly) cleared, I will keep using it. AirVisual not only tells you what the Air Quality Index (AQI) in your area is but also provides detailed information on what an AQI is and how it’s measured. The app provides both local and global (via a 3D globe) views of how our air is doing. It provides a ranked list of major cities based on air quality (thankfully San Francisco is now down to 68 ... during the intense smoke from the fires it was up near the top 10 of worst places to breathe), news articles on air quality and resources.  And there is more! Highly recommended.;;;;en

149;3451883809;5;Multiple Chemical Sensitivities;2018-11-23T19:17:27Z;realitynibs;I am coping with MCS and became acutely aware of the importance of outdoor air quality when the Camp Fire began in Northern California. Sometimes the air looks so bad that’s it’s obvious I need a mask to go outside. But on days when it’s less obvious I can look at my phone to find out whether I need to use my mask. Also I can look ahead to see which days I need to plan for low air quality.;;;;en

We are extremely polluted right now in the San Francisco Bay area because of the wildfires. With the single glance on the map display we can see how our relatives are doing in Grass Valley California and how things are in San Francisco and Palo Alto and anywhere else for that matter by simply zooming and scrolling.. With the favorite places page I can see details on cities I have selected with seven day forecast if I want. Right now severe pollution in San Francisco is still basically just the equivalent of a not too bad day in New Delhi!;;;;en

1567;2429424086;5;Helpful air quality information for indoor and outdoor;2018-04-16T12:54:06Z;Abp2011;Very interesting to see the air quality details change within your home and learn the why behind the data. The iq air quality monitor makes this app even better by providing different recommendations to improve your specific indoor AQi and when necessary, recommendations for keeping outdoor air out by closing windows, etc. This app, however, provides far more information than the iq aqi monitor alone so have more information available to compare current aqi with historical trends as well as current aqi in other cities you may be considering for future travels. I’ve recently changed the destination of our summer vacation based on the aqi information provided for Indonesia. I don’t want to expose our child to the air pollution for such an extended period of time. It really is very enlightening information to have at your fingertips. I really wish the CA school systems actively used this data available on the app at the very least, and at best both the aqi monitoring devices with the app to make more informed decisions about outdoor activities and when its best to limit young children and sensitive students to indoor activities to avoid exposure to the outdoor air pollution when aqi data is highest indicating poor air quality. The aqi data monitor could also help schools assess individual school locations and any need for improved ventilation or air purification systems within specific schools and/or districts. Thank you for making this data publicly accessible for all! Air quality is so important and often an overlooked space when assessing cause and effect with concerning health issues. I think this information being public can only  help encourage all countries to make improving air quality a priority. I hope more people start accessing and using this information to help guide their travels where the air is clean and safe for all, as well as encourage all of us to continue making efforts to improve our air quality and reduce air pollution starting with our own home energy usage. Please keep advancing research and technology! It is greatly appreciated!;;;;en

0;1444976984;5;Did my research, get it;2016-09-05T14:22:49Z;Grindelli;I have lived in China for 3 years and have a two-year old boy. Once he was born I became more interested in what all the AQI apps actually did and started researching them. AirVisual is by far the best one I have come across (having used 10+ different apps). Not only can you choose to use the US index (which I would highly recommend) you also can see which pollutants are contaminating the atmosphere at any given time. I also have a laser egg (also highly recommended) which is a portable particulate counter and the readings on my mobile device and the closest monitoring station on the app are always within +/-20 meaning they are not contradicting each other. On other apps there would often times be a 50 point+ difference between what my particulate counter read and the other random apps I was using. Also, do note that some apps do, like airvisual, have the different pollutants listed and their levels but airvisual is the only app I have found that combines that with the ability to choose the US AQI standard. My go-to app when it comes to air pollution.;;;;en

With continuing fires and air pollution in N California, I have developed bronchial irritation and increased congestion (which closely tracks air quality conditions reported by air visual). I attribute the good info to lots of reporting stations in my area.
Of particular interest is knowing when to ventilate my house (during periods of good air reported by air visual). Also, the app is helping me evaluate the performance of my whole house air filter system; my house filter helps but need improvement.
As a result of the app's functionality, I'm considering buying a larger version of IQAir's home air purifier as an adjunct to my whole house filtering.
I give a 4 star rating because there is always room for improvement.";;;;en

I essentially have to guesstimate based on the distant monitors that surround me.  The UI is perplexing; it apparently selects the closest monitor with a name that doesn't mean anything even though there's another monitor thats slightly closer.    Clicking on the monitor name doesn't show the map (or option for it); you have to bring up the separate map section and figure out where your monitor is and add other nearby monitors to your favorites.   Once figured out, it's quite useful for it's purpose but the UI needs to be simplified and hopefully a monitor from the airport will be added although I'm guessing that's out of the developers control.";;;;en

AirVisual has provided some great resources for me to plan out my days to minimize lung inflammation. Needless to say, this app has also encouraged me to move out of this area!

We have 3 people in our family with asthma, one of which has severe asthma. This app helps us to know when they are safe to play outside and when going to the museum or the mall would be a better idea. We live in the Rocky Mountains, so, the smoke can get pretty intense here during the summer, which makes us use the app multiple times a day. The only problem for us is that we live in the mountains so the air quality is different here (usually worse) than it is where the air quality monitor is. The closest monitor is 30-45 minutes from where we live. Other than that, we love this app!;;;;en

I can see it’s smokey outside on my own, but having the rating lends weight, objectivity, and a sense of whether we are headed for a clearing or bogged in for a long haul.  
The only points for improvement: it isn’t  in sync with AQI-US, which is typically lower in its rankings leaving one to wonder which data to trust.  Also, given how much AQ can vary in even short distances, it would be nice if it were easier to check the air in areas not included in the list of cities and not very close to the cities that are listed.";;;;en

Cons: forecasting air quality is not really possible in the same way as weather - even though this app was predicting that every day the AQI would keep rising to “Very Unhealthy”, it did not turn out that way in our location due to ever changing winds.

Maintains a clear and useful history by day, hour and moth, easy to read. Includes external community monitoring station results. Unfortunately, for unknown reasons, the latter is always 2 hours older than the continuous internal monitoring of the node. Therefore one cannot make clear inferences regarding the source of in-home contamination from the data displayed on the Node alone. Fortunately, EPA has an app, AirNow, that provides local outside AQI (by zip code) that is an hour or less old. This supplements the node and gives better perspective on relative AQI, without having to take the node outdoors every time one wants to compare. My Node went on the fritz once in February. Several calls to the company resulted in learning that the pm2.5 sensor can occasionally get a particle lodged inside that blocks its continuous monitoring ability. They informed me that this is easily corrected by a blast or two from a can of  compressed air. It worked, and the problem has not recurred in the approximately 5 months I have been using the Node.;;;;en

There is currently an air advisory due to smoke in my area. For some reason, this app is insisting that the AQI is ""Good"" despite the fact that I can actually see pollution in the air.

For example I have my device on all day. And the graph for “daily” report only shows info for 10am-2pm then a huge gap of no data, and then more reporting from 5pm-11pm, then a huge gap again between 11pm-2am. It’s completely random each day with times it will decide not to record info. The decide itself shows what happened over the last 24 hours fine. But the app shows these huge gaps which makes it useless since you can’t look back at history on the device itself beyond a day. So this problem with the app makes in unusable and also severely damaged the usability of the device too since you can’t access historical data beyond a day. This makes testing in a bad air home almost impossible to see if you are making any progress or not. For a $300 device, the app should work flawlessly with it.;;;;en

I live in Oregon and we had horrible air quality last summer, in the unhealthy range repeatedly, even crossing into hazardous at times. With many wildfires burning across our region, we are all jumpy in fear of a repeat. For some reason, despite consistently good air this year, the  app predicts unhealthy air 4 hours in the future every single day. During the first week I cancelled a number of recreational and outdoor activity plans based on these predictions. I am especially peeved about one of these cancellations, something that I really wanted to do and lost some reservation money. I followed the site for another week—same thing every day. I know air patterns and fire conditions can change rapidly but AirVisual was never correct.

My eyes  told me that I couldn’t see more than 1 mile because of smoke from wildfires  and my nose told me the air was like standing next to a bonfire roasting marshmallows. I am consigning this app to the trash can.;;;;en
1057;3027292554;1;Not impressed;2018-08-06T21:07:06Z;nmjsinclair;Having COPD, I wanted to really rely in this app. But I find it really inaccurate.  For example I just received a news alert that the air quality was in a high alert/dangerous level. This app is still showing it as good.  Not the first time this has happened—not even the 20th.  I really miss the American lung association app!;;;;en

My car is covered in soot, it looks like it is snowing outside, smoke is so thick street lights are on in the daytime. Government warnings are in effect for the whole area. This app says the air is great. No problems. It has been saying this for over 12 hours and the air is almost apocalyptic. Worthless. Don’t trust this app.;;;;en

1569;2032905844;1;Great idea but data doesn’t always update;2017-12-27T20:07:29Z;Ramdomnickname473628;I like the app except that it often won’t update to the current days air data. Right now the only data it will give me for my location is 4 days old.;;;;en
573;2012332809;1;Upgrade to worse;2017-12-20T17:21:32Z;Wys!wyg7;I like the old interface much better than the new one. The new one uses much lower color contrast making it more difficult to tell different air qualities. The old interface allows you to delete a location directly from the main page.

7;1601019558;1;Horribly inaccurate.;2017-04-30T01:43:28Z;Galia Stauffer;I live in South Korea and have for a total of 5 years, spread out over the last decade in a 3 year stay and now 2 years into a 5 year stay, in that time the air quality here has gotten much much worse. I was recently diagnosed with asthma (something that is apparently becoming more common for people in Seoul) and have to check the air quality regularly. If it's above 100 aqi I have to wear a special filter mask to leave the house. I got this app to make it easier to check the AQI regularly, one of the big draws for this app is it notifies me if the AQI goes above 100, or it's supposed to. Yesterday it never dropped below 100 and I never got a notification (thankfully I'd had the thought to check online before leaving the house) and upon checking the app it said an AQI of 63 when it was really 163. If you're relying on this app for all your AQI information and live in a city with poor air quality such as Seoul you may be putting your health at risk by relying on this app.;;;;en
2828;1404336381;1;Bad App;2016-07-02T22:34:12Z;1nEden;The info is inaccurate. My location had a green and yellow face past 2 days and we have had a orange Air Quality alert. Says is 39 and nearest station says 60. Worse than no info is wrong info. My lungs were not lying to me but this App was. Seems App only exists to sell/finance Node product. Shame on you!;;;;en
2835;1396610393;1;Research Scientist;2016-06-18T18:57:39Z;Elicia P;This app is completely inaccurate for Philadelphia. It always says the air quality is good, even when the weather and my experience says otherwise. Don't use for Philadelphia at least.;;;;en
3096;1343052514;1;Has Potential;2016-03-05T10:34:28Z;Snwbrdrgrl79;I got this app a few weeks ago because it seemed like the only one not concentrating not just China. I also got sick of checking aqicn.org when I needed an air quality update. The reason I say it has potential is that until recently it's worked flawlessly. For the last 24 hrs it's been un-updated. I'm currently residing in Sasebo Japan, where it turns out they don't inform you before you arrive, you get tons of crappy pollution from China in the form of PM 2.5. I have a 9 mos old son and a 5 yr old I'm trying to keep from developing childhood asthma. That's why air quality is so important to me. Hope they can work out the bugs!!;;;;en
