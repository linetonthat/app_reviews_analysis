I was recently diagnosed with asthma (something that is apparently becoming more common for people in Seoul) and have to check the air quality regularly. If it's above 100 aqi I have to wear a special filter mask to leave the house. I got this app to make it easier to check the AQI regularly, one of the big draws for this app is it notifies me if the AQI goes above 100, or it's supposed to. Yesterday it never dropped below 100 and I never got a notification (thankfully I'd had the thought to check online before leaving the house) and upon checking the app it said an AQI of 63 when it was really 163. If you're relying on this app for all your AQI information and live in a city with poor air quality such as Seoul you may be putting your health at risk by relying on this app.",,,,en,Horribly inaccurate .,"I live in South Korea and have for a total of 5 years , spread out over the last decade in a 3 year stay and now 2 years into a 5 year stay , in that time the air quality here has gotten much much worse .

I also got sick of checking aqicn.org when I needed an air quality update. The reason I say it has potential is that until recently it's worked flawlessly. For the last 24 hrs it's been un-updated. I'm currently residing in Sasebo Japan, where it turns out they don't inform you before you arrive, you get tons of crappy pollution from China in the form of PM 2.5. I have a 9 mos old son and a 5 yr old I'm trying to keep from developing childhood asthma. That's why air quality is so important to me. Hope they can work out the bugs!!",,,,en,Has Potential,"I got this app a few weeks ago because it seemed like the only one not concentrating not just China .
