Great app!

New update pretty much broke the app. Crashes all the time.";14890549.0;"Hi,

Thank you very much for your feedback. Sorry for your less than ideal experience with the new app. Please update the latest version v3.0.1. It should solve most of the problems you were facing with the v3.0.0.

Please feel free to send me your feedback and comments at antoine.simon@plumelabs.com. I would be thrilled to discuss with you about our new app.

All the best, Antoine Simon, Product Manager.";2020-04-24T12:45:36Z;en

2;3969994802;5;So far so good!;2019-04-04T21:48:24Z;littleapples;Just learned about this and got it on the basis of the reviews. I intend to go with the Flow as well. I cannot judge the accuracy but it seems to offer so much more than the apps I had been using, and I am very susceptible to pollution-related health issues. I do have the luxury of choosing where I get my exercise and I expect this to help me decide where to spend time. If it helps me I will also be sharing information about this product with elderly neighbors as respiratory issues loom large in this part of the world.;;;;en
8;3951711532;5;Awesome;2019-03-31T14:32:10Z;LeChatParle;Pollution data shouldn’t stop you from exercising. Studies have shown that even in cities as polluted as many Chinese or Indian cities, up to 30 minutes of exercise is still beneficial. In western cities with lower pollution levels, it would often take 15-20 hours of constant exposure prior to the exercise outside being bad for your health. For people in the west, it’s never a bad time to exercise.;;;;en

7;3100738108;5;Breathe Easy and Clear;2018-08-22T21:53:17Z;Seeking Language Genius Status;Plume is by far the absolute best monitor and reporter of air quality. Plume allows me to be proactive.  Plume shows the air quality so that I can make sure that I am located by an air filter when the air quality index is high and this shows why my asthma is bad. No other app does this.

87;1326349094;5;Great app;2016-02-02T02:10:06Z;Just336674;"Great app with a simple and friendly user interface. Has PM2.5 now with recent update, however it would be nice to see and graph every parameter at each station. You also can't see CO in the current day view, but you can see it in the week view (bug?).

Even if it has its issues, I can tell this is a very active developer, and I wouldn't be surprised if this becomes the best and most simple to use pollution forecasting app. I see this app as becoming the Dark Sky of pollution forecasting.

If you want power user features while sacrificing user interface, there are apps that can give you more data and access to specific stations.";;;;en

1;2030111284;4;Look no further!;2017-12-26T22:04:10Z;Jacques Matineau;"This app does what is says and quite well. 

I’ve used it in Chinese, Japanese and English and the functionality was consistent across all three languages. 

The limitations I could see were;

(1) there was no way to modify the city list; you have to first delete the cities and re-enter them in the order you prefer. 

(2) when you delete a city, the last city in your list is “promoted” to top of the list.  That makes it even harder to re-sequence your list...

and, 

(3) there is no way to select which city appears in the widget, so if you want to see your city at a glance (in the widget) it has to be at the top of your cities.  Otherwise you have to fiddle around with the list, back to (1) and (2).

Finally (4), there is no way to add air quality tracking stations that may not otherwise be listed in the city list. 

Truth be said, these are really minor points that don’t take away from the functionality and useful information, at all. 

Great app. Recommend it if you’re tracking air quality in your area.";2145616.0;Many thanks for your review and detailed feedback!

I have not analyzed the accuracy of the data, and I am sure that in a large city such as Toulouse it might be inaccurate depending on where you are, but as far as using it as a general indicator as when to plan our outings with our infant, it's useful. I wish there were more data samplings that would allow the app to differentiate pollution levels between a secluded park and a major motorway.
