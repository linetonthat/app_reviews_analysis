1;5387399470;5;Really useful information;2020-01-11T01:19:08Z;Suez62;"We have an ‘eco’ woodburner and as an asthmatic I have noticed that I am symptomatic on the days it is lit. We love the stove and use it a lot in the evenings. 
It burns very cleanly so I was wondering if particulates are escaping when the door is opened to add wood.
The monitor showed that the problem is just when the kindling is lit and the door has to be left slightly ajar. As soon as the stove reaches temperature there are no more peaks to purple even with the door opened.
I now wear a mask when lighting the stove until the air quality improves ( 5-10 mins with ventilation) and am considering buying an IQ air purifier. 
Other helpful info was a rise to red when cooking on the hob including an increased humidity reading in the house. This was rectified by cleaning the extractor hood filters.
The high C02 readings when all the family was in one room has led us to ventilate the house more and this really improves air quality as seen by the green readings.

All in all a very useful purchase-easy to set up and use and great for anyone with allergies to see what may be triggering symptoms. 
Highly recommended.";;;;en

0;4915894551;5;A tragic reality;2019-10-10T01:06:52Z;Si & Ro;"Amazingly helpful app, both for health and as a driver of environmental action. Awful to see the country I live in has removed the app from its domestic app stores while leading a campaign to discredit the horrific readings it relays simply because polluting the air is how companies (and governments) make short-term profits.

It seems we have entered an age of anti science, where the most ignorant minds feel legitimized in overlooking the work and the warnings of the most intelligent, simply because what they’re seeing and reading doesn’t match their own blinkered agenda.

Download this app, tell your friends to download this app, share the information and never lose sight of how bad the situation really is. If not for you, do it for your kids.";;;;en

5;4066024368;5;Excellent air quality app;2019-04-27T07:09:38Z;Dubz07;"I used this whilst traveling when I noticed I was struggling with a sore throat and itchy eyes whenever I went outside (it wasn't hayfever season); I was shocked to see how poor the air quality was in the location I was visiting and it allowed me to avoid going outside when the quality was at its worst.

Since returning to the UK I still use it to monitor air auality and whilst most the time it's green, it's good to get alerts when things get worse.

It's very localised and you have the option to add your own air quality unit to your house, then share the data with the app.

Really nicely done app. Recommended for the curious or those who suffer when air quality is poor.";;;;en

I have tested many other apps, none has such friendly UI and abundance of data.
I wish is that AirVisual would include PM10 sensors, so I could just use 1 app (getting PM10 info from AirMatters).
The bubbly notifier (the number on app icon) need to be force updated, so it is great idea, but kinda pointless, as I have to open the app anyway to update it.

Overall, the app is not ideal, still gets 5 stars as the best in AppStore. Hopefully the development will continue and make competition irrelevant.

I think the other cities are accurate.";;;;en
