You think someone having a serious health problem ha time to do all your stupid steps? The priority here is access to crucial information. How IGNORANT of the developers to put up a stupid sign up first. GET RID OF IT. YOU GIVE PEOPLE THE OPTION AND IF THEY DONT WANT TO, THEN THAT IS THEIR DECISION. You don\u2019t force that choice on anyone. PEOPLE HAVING MEDICAL EMERGENCIES AND ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS AN EXTRA SUBSCRIBER FOR YOU TO SPAM."},
