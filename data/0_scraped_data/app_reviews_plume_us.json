My children also use this App on their own now. \nI love the new improvements and the ease of use. As an outdoor athlete it has helped me tremendously in managing the quality and amount of time I spend outside over the last year which in turn has impacted my health and the health of my family. I highly recommend."},

That makes it even harder to re-sequence your list...\n\nand, \n\n(3) there is no way to select which city appears in the widget, so if you want to see your city at a glance (in the widget) it has to be at the top of your cities.  Otherwise you have to fiddle around with the list, back to (1) and (2).\n\nFinally (4), there is no way to add air quality tracking stations that may not otherwise be listed in the city list. \n\nTruth be said, these are really minor points that don\u2019t take away from the functionality and useful information, at all. \n\nGreat app. Recommend it if you\u2019re tracking air quality in your area.", "response_id": 2145616, "dev_response": "Many thanks for your review and detailed feedback!

I live in DC and downloaded this App a week ago. In that time, this App has told me that DC's particulate pollution is at the very highest levels at times (above 300 or above 600, for example). Other times, it tells me DC's pollution is zero particles. The bottom line is that it's not a reliable App and has inaccurate data underlying its results."},
