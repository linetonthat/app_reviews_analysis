I use this app to check the air quality in Korea. But the number that this app reports is almost always higher than the Naver number, which is probably most correct in Korea. If it’s :( unhealthy on AirVisual, it’s just :/ not good on Naver. or if it’s :/ not good on AirVisual, it’s :| ok on Naver. It can be good to be cautious though! 

The worst part about this app is the UI. Swiping from the left never works to go back to the previous screen so I have to move my hand and push the back button in the top left corner. So annoying! There are a lot of menus on the bottom that I never click on like a map, a world ranking, and other not-that-useful stuff. Overall, it’s not that nice to look at and a bit frustrating to navigate.

I really was hoping this app would work, but there are FAR too many times it will say it’s a green air quality day with little or no particulate concerns when in reality it’s an orange or red air day. 

For example today there is literally ash falling from the sky as a result of a near by wildfire....and the app says it’s a Green Day with only 11 US AQI. If I look it up on a trusted web site it says it’s a red air day with 191 AQI. Since I can physically see particles in the air and even indoors can only smell smoke, I’m sure you can understand which one is the accurate one.
